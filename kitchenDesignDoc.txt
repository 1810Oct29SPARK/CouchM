layout kitchen elements in html
style in css

in js:
creating multiple objects within the game space: tools, ingredients, and appliances
click on tools to select
while selected, click on ingredient to 'measure'
while 'measured,' click on bowl tool to add
repeat for all ingredients
use whisk tool to mix when necessary
boil water for mix by selecting pot tool, selecting sink appliance, then selecting stove top appliance
select completed mix, select cake pans tool(s), select oven appliance

a recipe tool is in the game space
clicking it will open a page(window) displaying recipe information
clicking anywhere will close

clicking oven appliance will open panel(window) with arrows to set temperature and time
clicking anywhere will close

if all ingredients measured && oven temp and time set correctly, "success" GUI appears
else, "not quite" GUI
"play again" button in the center of GUI

I'm still foggy on how pulling info from an API works, but I would want to pull from the page where I found the recipe itself
It sounds like we'll be going over that soon
