What is an http(hyper text transfer protocol) request?
	A request has:
		A URL -> (address of the resource being requested)
		Headers -> (metadata about the request [encoding, content type, origin...)
		Body -> (content)
		Method/Verb 	-> (what kind of request is it?)
				-> GET, POST
		HTTP Version

Difference between GET and POST requests:

	GET 	-> sending info in the URL
		-> e.g. www.google.com/search?q=cats
		-> NOT good for anything sensitive
		-> limited in size of what can be sent

	POST 	-> sending info in the request body
		-> NOT limited in size
		-> better for sensitive information
